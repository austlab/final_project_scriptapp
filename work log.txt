------------------------------
- Commented out everything related to databases. Focusing primarily on the basic function of the script.
- Completed functions to get dictionary and image data from nasa API. Couldn't figure out why the image wasn't saving, realized save_image_file was nested in an if statement related to databases.
- added 2 functions to calculate hash value and size of image in bytes.
- Completed function to get dictionary of APOD at a specific date.
- Couldn't figure out how to get hash value of image directly, getting error related to 'utf-8'. Opted to hash the url of the image. This isn't optimal as the url could potentially change one day but the hash value of the image should always be static.

-----------------------------
- Began work with database, imported sqlite3.
- Completed create_db function with columns for identifiable information about the image.
- Completed add_db function, inserts the identifiable information into the columns.
- Completed image_in_db function which queries a column in the database. If a value already exists function returns true.

---------------------------
- Finished last function to set desktop background. 
- Imported ctypes module.
- Line of code to change desktop background was pulled from lab 9.
- Added lines of output in 'print_apod_info' and 'image_in_db' functions to make the script output easily understood.
- Tested program for functionality.
